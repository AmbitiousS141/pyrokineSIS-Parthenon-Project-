        <h2>About Our Project!</h2>
        <h3>Stephanie Uzea</h3>
        <p>I'm a 15-year-old from Ottawa, Canada! I'm an aspiring mechatronics engineer and web dev enthusiast :D </p>
        <p>Kylie, Isa and I thought of pyrokineSIS before bed on Friday, with the inspirational words of Tarika Barrett and other women who lead still replaying in our minds. We chose to name it so because the word is a kind of power, like the power that all girls have within themselves - that they must let shine, that they must use to help their sisters. Through fun games with empowering messages, pyrokineSIS aims to subconsciously change girls' mindsets to know and show their worth. We hope you enjoy our scavenger hunt on this page, or our decrypting challenges that you can access by clicking the logo in the top left corner!</p>
        <p>I designed the pyrokyneSIS logo using Canva. PyrokineSIS' pages were put together with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. Our team had some issues finding a collaboration method that worked for us, but Zach showed us how to set up GitHub Desktop (and we improved our communication skills), so from there, edits went pretty smoothly. We also had to change the functionality of our website to be able to ship it by the deadline - we learned how to work under pressure, prioritize tasks and take risks. Big thanks to Zach, Celeste... the <i>whole</i> Hack Club team and the Parthenon participants for the 24/7 guidance and energy :D It was such a supportive environment and I enjoyed meeting everyone! </p>

        <h3>Isabella Ruiz </h3>
        <p>We made this project to inspire sisterhood 
            like one on the core values in GirlsWhoCode! 
            For a twist we decided to implement a scavenger hunt! 
            We made using html,js and css!🔥I personally struggle with make a clear decryption code
        but decided to make a simple easy one and fun! I learn to add collabortions parts in VS and GITHUB and code with others! </p>
