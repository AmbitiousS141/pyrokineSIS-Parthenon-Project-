    <h2>Read the story! Then find the hidden highlighted quote! </h2>
    <p>Once upon a time in a universe, there was a lot of dark matter, and there was so much of it that it created a pink blob named Kirby. 
    He took a deep breath and <b>inhale</b>d and exhaled... a lot of food. Until he met someone,
    and since Kirby thought he was the only person in the world, he was excited.
    Then one day, the person he met complimented him, and suddenly Kirby felt something.
    He gained something he hadn't really 100% felt before.. 
    The <b>confidence</b> he gained was so much that every time he <b>exhale</b>d, he felt lighter. 
    He swore with a reasonable <b>doubt</b>. So Kirby and his new friend became stronger than ever!</p>
